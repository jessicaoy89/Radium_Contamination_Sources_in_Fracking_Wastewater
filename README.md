## Installation
There is no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.

## Project Motivation
With this project, I am interestested in using chemistry data fracking wastewater published by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, US Geologic Survey, and other institutes through the past ~50 years to assist me understand:
- How can we partition sources of Ra contamination in wastewater?
- Can we predict the level of contribution of Ra from different sources with machine learning regression models?
- Or can we classify if a source may contribute to Ra contaminant for a given wastewater?
- What are the major features determining Ra contamination sources?

## File Descriptions
There is one jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook searched through the survey data with markdown cells used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is one .csv file that contains the chemistry data used in this project. Sensitive information such as company names are removed for ethnicity.

## Results
The major findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@bingjie.j.ouyang/a-peek-into-sources-of-radium-contamination-related-to-fracking-d2d9749d9f44).
